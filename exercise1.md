I chose Java for the team's coding language. Some specific tools for continuous integration (CI) with Java could include, for example, Checkstyle or built-in IDE tools (such as IntelliJ or Eclipse) for linting, JUnit for unit testing, and Maven or Gradle for building. 
Some alternatives for setting up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions are CircleCI, GitLab CI, Atlassian Bamboo, JetBrains TeamCity, Buildkite pipelines, Spacelift, TravisCI, and Codeship. These are listed as some of the most popular alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions. 
Because this is a smaller project with a team of only six people, I would choose a cloud-based environment like GitHub Actions for the CI, as it would likely be cheaper and simpler to configure. There is no need to set up our own system from scratch, which would require additional resources. The information needed to make the decision about whether to choose a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment could include the size of the project, any potential special requirements (e.g., a need for a graphics card to run specific tests), and also if anyone on the team has strong competence in any of these environments. This competence could help a lot with the configuration and setup process.
